          <li>The preferred MIDI output device is now tracked by name rather than by port number, which is more robust if e.g. a new device is plugged in</li>
          <li>Chord names can now use a custom label instead of the auto-generated chord name. This is primarily used for chords imported from Guitar Pro files (#442)</li>

          <li>Fixed potential crashes when importing Guitar Pro files (#442, #444)</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug where the caret was rendered when printing or displaying a print preview (#441)</li>
          <li>Fixed issues where the top fret number of a chord diagram could be cut off in the chord name dialog (#408)</li>
          <li>Fixed a crash when an alternate ending was located on the last position of a system (#449)</li>
          <li>Fixed a crash during playback when a score contained a `Fine` symbol (#470)</li>
